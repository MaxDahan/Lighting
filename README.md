# Lighting

To run Calendar just download the zip and extract wherever you would like. The data folder is unrelated to the jar because the jar was made without using the image in data. The jar only has preset lighting colors. Green is on top, Blue is on the right, Red is on the left, White is on the bottom, and Black is in the center. To change the light sources (size, location, color, opacity) it must be changed in the source code. The project also includes a random image that can be drawn by un-commenting a line of code in the paint method of Game. The point of this project is to have a good looking light graphic that can be re-used in other programs or games.
